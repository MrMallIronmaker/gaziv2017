##Introduction

###Summary and Motivation

This paper studies *nonverbal synchrony*, the natural coordination of body movement between interacting individuals. Nonverbal synchrony is defined as a dynamic quality of movement, measured objectively and automatically, including both simultaneous movement and movement in a short time-lagged window [@Ramseyer2011]. To put it poetically, it is the individual words of body language. 
Early studies (1970s-1990s) were limited by quality or quantity of data. Individual body motions were collected by human coders, proving expensive in time or money. In contrast, in order to collect data on many subjects, the analysis was computational, and computers only measured motion holistically. 
Virtual reality tracking and today's devices like the Microsoft Kinect can collect nonverbal data with both quality and quantity. The challenge to current research, then, is finding, validating, and motivating methods with which to analyze the data. 
I plan to use a measure of synchrony in future studies, and so both developing the code to complete a data analysis pipeline and understanding the space and dangers in some of the analyses would be helpful to my future work.

###Procedure and Challenges

The data pipeline I will replicate mirrors the analysis given in the paper:

1. Smooth and clean the Kinect tracking data. This involves dropping frames and body parts that were not tracked in some frames, and smoothing the remaining data.
2. Convert position data to the more theoretically and perceptually salient velocity data.
3. Analyze the joint velocities using principal component analysis (PCA), and verifying their size relative to shuffled data as a control.
4. Use the PCA basis to determine whether a segment is a still, solo, or co-active motion segment.
5. Considering only the co-active motion segments, run PCA again to find the common co-active motion modes.
6. Calculate motion motifs by comparing against a time-rotated control dataset.

The results to replicate include:

1. Torso motion is the strongest component in PCA, accounting for 57%-95% of variance
2. Arm motion is the second strongest component, but it is much weaker.
3. Parallel-synchronized torso motion and mutual stillness are the two motion motifs.
4. Dyads show individuality in their mode distributions, i.e, the same dyad at different times or in different tasks show distributions more similar than different dyads in the same distribution.

The challenges will be both methodological and technical. The method as written appears to be unclear or underspecified at points. This is compounded by the complexity of the analysis. When two results do not match up, it may be an error from method, reporting, understanding, or programming - and if that data analysis had multiple steps before reaching a verifiable value, then a problem can exist in any or all of those steps.

##Methods

###Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

###Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


##Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.

###Data Preparation

####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
